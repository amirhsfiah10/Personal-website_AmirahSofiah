		    	<p><blockquote>My name is Amirah Sofiah Binti Mahyuddin, first daughter of a sweet couple, Mr. Mahyuddin Yaacob and Mrs. Latifah Amir. I was born on 10 <sup>th</sup> of February 2001 at Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah, Klang. Currently, I am living at Klang, Selangor. My family and I are planning to move and stay at our hometown, Banting after my father retire. I am officially 21 years old this year and will graduate my studies in Diploma as well. Currently, I am still studying at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara">UiTM</abbr></a>, Rembau Campus and one of the diploma student in <abbr title="Information Management">IM</abbr></a>. I am not planning to continue my studies in Degree, since I want to focus more in building my career first. I want to experience the meaning of real life, most importantly to repay all of my parents' kindness and efforts in raising me until today.
		    	</p>

		    	<p>My family is just like a normal typical Malaysian family. There are my parents, me, younger brother (20 years old) and younger sister (17 years old). My father works at Faculty Music, <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara">UiTM</abbr></a>, Shah Alam for almost 25 years, meanwhile my mother is a housewife. My mother used to work at <abbr title="Universiti Teknologi Mara">UiTM</abbr></a>
		    	 until she gave birth to my younger brother in 2002. I have a very good relationship with my siblings. I will always be there for them whenever they need. As the eldest, I am trying my best to help them either in studies or life sharing. 
		        </p>
		        <p>How can I describe about myself? I believe that everyone on this world will say that LIFE is the reason how we identify and discover our own strengths and weaknesses. As for my strengths, I can say that I am a well-organized person. Before I start doing anything, either buying groceries or completing my assignments, I will make sure that I take note everything that is important and need to do first. As someone that perfectionist, I really want every of my works done properly. Besides that, I am also a hard-working person. During my school life, I participated in marching. At first, I don't even have the basic knowledge about marching. Thus, it make me wants to do better and work hard. I join the extra class for marching everyday including weekend. All of my efforts succeed when my school's team received some awards from the competitions. In terms of weaknesses, I do have a lot such as I love to sleep and spend my money buy foods. I guess it become my habits and totally bad for myself. For now, I am still trying to change those habits. 
		        </p>
		        <p>If I want to talk about my dream, every since kids I really want to become a teacher. Because I love to teach and most of my family works as teacher which are my grandfather and uncles. One of my uncle also taught me in Mathematics when I was 8 years old. I really adore on how he became successful with the title of a TEACHER. However, as I grow older, I think that teacher is not the most suitable dream that I may achieve in the mean time. With no proper plan about on what I am going to do in future, I chose to just continue studies in diploma, which currently I am doing. I don't really expect much, I just hope that I may become someone that is great, determined and benefits to all people.</p></blockquote>
